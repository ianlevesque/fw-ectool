Description: ChromeOS Embedded Controller Tool
 This package provides the ectool utility for communicating with
 ChromeOS embedded controllers (EC). It allows you to query and
 control various EC features including:
  - Fan control (speed, duty cycle, automatic control)
  - Battery information
  - Temperature sensors
  - Keyboard backlight
  - Power management
  - And many other EC-related functions
 .
 This tool is particularly useful for Framework Laptops and other
 devices that use ChromeOS-compatible embedded controllers.
